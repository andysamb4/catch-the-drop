# Stock Universe — 3-Day Drop & Climb

The predefined set of tickers the nightly cron scans for 3-day drop/climb signals and yo-yo scoring. Snapshot taken **2026-07-03** from the current S&P 500 and Nasdaq-100 constituent lists.

**514 tickers** — 500 S&P 500, 100 Nasdaq-100 (86 in both, 14 Nasdaq-100-only).

## Why this universe

- **Index-derived, not curated.** Every name is a current S&P 500 or Nasdaq-100 constituent, so liquidity, size, and eToro availability are near-guaranteed without per-ticker judgment calls. The universe is *who we scan*; the watchlist (Phase 2) is the ranked subset we actually monitor and trade.
- **Refresh quarterly.** Index committees add/remove a handful of names per quarter. Re-run the snapshot around each rebalance (third Friday of March, June, September, December) and diff against the `tickers` table — deactivate removals rather than deleting them so historical signals/trades keep their foreign keys.
- **Secondary share classes excluded** to avoid duplicate signals on the same company: GOOG (kept GOOGL), FOX (kept FOXA), NWS (kept NWSA).

## Seed files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| [`data/universe.csv`](../data/universe.csv) | Canonical list — human-diffable, import into the DB |
| [`data/universe.json`](../data/universe.json) | Same data, import-ready for a TypeScript seed script |

Suggested table shape: `symbol (PK), name, sector, in_sp500, in_nasdaq100, active (default true), added_at` — plus the yo-yo score columns once Phase 2 lands.

## Symbol format gotchas

- **Dots vs hyphens:** class shares use dots here (`BRK.B`, `BF.B`), matching index conventions. Most price APIs want hyphens (`BRK-B`) — normalize in the data-fetch layer, keep the dotted form as the canonical DB key.
- **Ticker reuse:** index tickers occasionally get reused by different companies after removals. Always match on symbol *and* active flag, never symbol alone across time.

## Signal-volume expectation

With ~514 tickers, expect roughly 10–15% to have just completed a 3-day streak on any given day — **~55–85 raw signals daily**. The signals page must rank (yo-yo score) and filter (trend/earnings guards), not just list.
